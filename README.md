EpicGuard is a bot protection plugin for minecraft servers, supporting bukkit, bungeecord and velocity environments. Highly configurable and customizable.

## Building

The final jar file will be located in `build/libs/EpicGuard-<version>-all.jar`

## Some features
 * All checks can be configured as you want, you can make them checking every time, only during an attack or disable some of them completely.
 * Compatible with Spigot, PaperSpigot (and other forks), BungeeCord, Waterfall (and other forks), and Velocity.
 * Block VPNs and proxies, using the proxycheck.io service (or other api, if you want).
 * Allow or block specific countries/cities.
 * Automatic whitelisting, so real players won't be affected during bot attack.
 * Attack status displayed on the action bar.
 * Filter unwanted console messages.
 * Throttle connections to the server.
 * Limit how many nicknames can be used by one IP address.
 * Force users to ping the server or add it to their server list.
